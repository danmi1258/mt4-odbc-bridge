# About MT4-ODBC Bridge

This is a library for the popular trading terminal, MetaTrader4 (MT4),
to give access to a relational database through ODBC interface. The
main features are as follows.

- Recording price data
- Synchronizing trade status
- Executing orders

MT4 has its own programming language, MQL4, for algorithmic
trading. Though it is easy to learn, its expressiveness is very
limited. People who want to execute more sophisticated algorithm tend
to resort to outside of MT4, typically using DLL. But the native
programming of DLLs is restricted to the Windows platform, which is
not familiar to mainstream programmers of the recent open source
movement.

MT4-ODBC Bridge (MOB in short) provides a buffer area onto a RDBMS
like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc. Such database is general enough
for the most open source programmers. You can access to tha database
by your familiar language, or maybe directly by SQL.
